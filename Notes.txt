1. Using NextJS to create the project(use app/router while installing).
2.Then using shadcn to install the library components to use the dark mode for easy components installation.
3.Then for authentication use OAuth by Google.
4.For Logo use "UIlogos.co"
5.Then we have to use ConvexDB for the database integration
(
    npm i convex
    use npx convex dev 
)
6.With the help of useContext from "react" it was easy to implement the convex db as its need to be installed by us and then connected to
our project
